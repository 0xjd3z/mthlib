## About
A trivial math library in python. I've embarked on this project in order to learn about stuff in python. Stuffs like:
<li> The Python Object Model: Python's abstractions of objects.
<li> how to package a python project in a github repo
<li> python's suite of Sequence abstract base classes (the ABC library). Python's extensible collection.ABC module for building powerful data structures.
